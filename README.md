# Option-Indexed-Hierarchical-RL

I am currently doing my dual degree thesis project at IIT Madras under Prof. Balaraman Ravindran on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning. In Option-Indexed Hierarchical RL, we learn an affinity function between options and the items present in the environment. This allows us to effectively reuse a large library of pre-trained options (lifelong learning setting) in zero-shot generalization at test time by restricting goal-directed learning to only those options relevant to the task at hand. This project is a collaboration between IIT Madras and Google Research, India. We submitted our work to the Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems Conference 2023 under Learning and Adaptation. 
 
I ideated and implemented a co-occurrence-based representation for options to match them to tasks efficiently. [Matching options to tasks using Option-Indexed Hierarchical RL.pdf](Matching options to tasks using Option-Indexed Hierarchical RL.pdf) summarizes the key ideas from our work.
